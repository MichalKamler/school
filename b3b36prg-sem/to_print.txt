    there are several keyboard inputs:
        'q' - quit, quits the program
        'a' - abort, aborts the computation
        'g' - get, get version of computational_module
        's' - set, sets parametres for next computation
        'c' - compute, computes referece complex plain
        '1' - compute, computes complex plain set by user
        '←' - moves complex plain left
        '↑' - moves complex plain up 
        '→' - moves complex plain right
        '↓' - moves complex plain down
        'i' - in, zooms in 
        'o' - out, zooms out
        'l' - deletes current content of computation (buffer)
        'e' - adds to real part of complex plain
        'r' - lessens the real part of complex plain
        't' - adds to imaginary part of complex plain
        'y' - lessens the imaginary part of complex plain
        'm' - adds to number of iterations
        'n' - lessens the number of iterations
